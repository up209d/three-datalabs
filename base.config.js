// !!! IMPORTANT !!!
// A base name is the base path if our project build will be sitting in sub directory
// So the basename config to createBrowserHistory and all Router with basename will solve that problem

// basename is for AJAX uses also
module.exports = ''; // Should leave it blank if no using, otherwise it has to start with a slash
